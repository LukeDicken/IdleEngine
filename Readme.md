### Idle Engine
## An engine for idle/incremental/clicker games

The point of the Idle Engine is to create a content-agnostic engine for web-based clicker games.

The core of the engine is separate from the content and from the UI

The first pass of Idle Engine support
- currencies
- actions
  - costs
  - rewards
  - coditional visibility
  
This is a minimal first pass. Concepts expected to be included at some point included auto-clickers and buffs.
I'd also quite like to include some MMO concepts by letting players interact with each other.
